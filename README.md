Assembly-RT
===========

The assembly language is always my favorite. While hacking with Windows RT, I just find out that this platform gives me enormous fun since this is a well-documented-in-general-but-highly-undocumented-in-detail system (I'm doing desktop stuffs).

Anyway it looks familiar, runs familiar, however to let it work correctly, you have to code differently. So I'm writing the difference that I faced in this repo as an interesting introduction. Hope somebody can find it is helpful.

I hate to say this, but before you go any further, I suggest you to be quite familiar with x86 assembly language, and have a good understanding about how Windows works. However if you don't know any of them, just Google whatever you don't know. After all, this is an introduction and I'm trying to keep it simple.

Also I strongly recommend to get a Surface RT with Type Cover 2 since there is no emulator so far.
