Register
========

Unlike x86 architecture, Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) architecture is oddly enough under a RISC design, which means compared to x86, ARM has less instruction and more register in general.The first question I came up with while I was learning ARM assembly is, how those registers work? After all, there are 16 general registers, which were named from r0 to r15, and those names are anything but helpful.
